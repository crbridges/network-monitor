Network Monitoring Tool

This is a program that monitors a set of user defined servers with user defined protocols. A management service is
used to establish and control multiple remote monitoring services. The services communicate through TCP sockets.

The service parameters are hard coded in the program as a list with the following format:
        services = ["SERVICE_NAME", "SERVER_ADDRESS", INTERVAL]

The network_monitoring_examples.py file is required for the monitor service to run.

The monitor service can be run from the command line with 'python ./monitor_server1.py', 'python ./monitor_server2.py',
    and 'python ./monitor_server3.py'.
The management service can be run from the command line with 'python ./management_clent.py'
